Simple DOS tool I made ages ago
![image]()

Usage
----------

**Can be run locally but a VPS is recommended**

```terminal
    perl script.c
```

Compile to .exe
----------
**Must have pyinstaller installed:**
```python
    pip install pytinstaller
```
cd to the scripts directory then run:
```python
    pyinstaller --onefile script.c
```

Login
----------
You can add your own logins into the script but the default is:
```terminal
    username: karan
    Password: karan
```

I am not responsible for anythin that comes from this scripts usage
